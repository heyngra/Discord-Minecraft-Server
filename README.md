With it you can make your own autoupdating message with stats on your Discord Server!
## Setup
Download the latest version from [releases] and run the installpackages.py file. Then open run.py file and wait until it closes. Do not care about the errors. Open the config file and insert here your data, except of messageID, you will collect it later. How to get your data will be down below. You need to run it again and the test message will appear. Close application and fill last place with messageID with ID of message sent. Now it should work.



##How to collect data

1. To get token go to [discord.com/developers](https://discord.com/developers/applications). Create new application, then bot in it. Copy the token and insert.
2. To get the channelID you need to enable the developer mode, then click on channel and copy the ID and insert.

3. To get messageID you need to make the same what you did in 2. but you need to get the ID of an message that will be send by running the bot without it.
4. To get the IP you just write the IP of an server you connect it. F.E. hypixel.net
