Do not care about the errors. Open the config file and insert here your data, except of messageID, you will collect it later. How to get your data will be down below. You need to run it again and the test message will appear. Close application and fill last place messageID with ID of message sent. Now it should work. If you something goes wrong and application would crash you should try open the app via cmd.exe and if there are any errors report them on the github.



## How to collect data

1. To get token go to [discord.com/developers](https://discord.com/developers/applications). Create new application, then bot in it. Copy the token and insert.
2. To get the channelID you need to enable the developer mode, then click on channel and copy the ID and insert.
3. To get messageID you need to make the same what you did in 2. but you need to get the ID of an message that will be send by running the bot without it.
4. To get the IP you just write the IP of an server you connect it. F.E. hypixel.net
